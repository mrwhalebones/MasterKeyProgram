# MasterKeyProgram
WIF key generator for doing the generating of the WIFs(made for puzzle solving)


I was suposed to be starting a new job requiring two good legs and messed my foot up temporarily. If you want to donate for the free program and the hours I put into debugging and testing, here is my coinbase address: 34aYRB9jeSDXxNpjZBZpfETLJ2Tcw1H36G

This final version will be the powerhouse: âœ… Legacy address input with full manual range control âœ… Hex â†’ WIF â†’ ECDSA â†’ Address (compressed & uncompressed) âœ… Two generation modes: Linear (manual input) & Random (Ï€-based randomization) âœ… Live progress tracking & multithreading to prevent UI freeze-ups âœ… Popup menu dynamically displaying unsolved puzzles!

I am trying to make it super user friendly. the batch script is assuming you are running a drive E: with the files directly in it. modify it by selecting from file explorer(copy as path and just copy and paste over the path using the main python file as your selection and right click if in windows to initiate the copying and pasting of the file path or if a linux person..... you probably don't need the extra info ;-P )

I'm thinking of showing an x,y graph of key pairs so verification the same key being done over and over doesn't happen.

more like this:

Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ll integrate into the final fully functional script: âœ… Unique file creation per puzzle (Puzzle Number + Timestamp Naming) âœ… List every hexadecimal key tested in each file âœ… Live visualization using an X,Y graph (instead of a progress bar) âœ… Multithreading for optimized puzzle solving âœ… Real-time WIF-to-address conversion without unnecessary storage. Makes sense?

AES encryption for key ciphering and decipheringâ€”it adds an extra layer of security and functionality. ðŸš€ Since this is a C-based implementation, Iâ€™ll need to adapt it to Python so it can seamlessly integrate into our/the existing framework.

I'll integrate exportable CSV file generation for solved puzzles. ðŸš€

ðŸ”¹ How It Will Work: âœ… Each puzzle will generate a unique file (Puzzle Number + Timestamp) âœ… The file will log every hexadecimal key tested âœ… If a puzzle is solved, the corresponding private key will be saved âœ… The results will be formatted as CSV for easy use and further analysis

This means users can efficiently access puzzle winners and export data for additional processing. Iâ€™ll finalize this alongside the X,Y graph visualization, multithreaded search, Ï€-randomization, and improved UI

ðŸ”¥ How I'm Integrating It

âœ… Convert the AES key handling into a Python-compatible encryption module âœ… Allow users to encrypt and decrypt private keys before processing âœ… Ensure secure handling of WIF generation and puzzle-solving âœ… Integrate with multi-threading, so encryption doesnâ€™t slow down searches

I'll incorporate this functionality alongside the X,Y graph visualization, Ï€-randomization, and legacy address override while ensuring everything remains optimized for speed and efficiency. Stay tunedâ€”Iâ€™m making this final build legendary! ðŸ”¥ðŸš€

ðŸ”¥ Final Features Being Integrated

âœ… Selectable API Call System:

Users can choose between an HTTPS-based API or a Local RPC Bitcoin node

Enables automatic address generation and verification

âœ… Full Puzzle Solver with Dynamic Data Handling:

Puzzle generation between correct nonce ranges

Automatic puzzle tracking and output logging

Multithreaded searching for faster results

CSV export option for solved puzzles

âœ… Advanced Key Processing & Encryption:

64-bit hex generation using Ï€-randomization

Hex â†’ WIF â†’ ECDSA â†’ Address conversions (both compressed & uncompressed)

AES encryption for key ciphering & deciphering

âœ… Real-time Graph Visualization & UI Enhancements:

X,Y graph replaces standard progress bar

Hover descriptions for buttons to reduce clutter

Copyable WIF outputs for seamless use

ðŸ”œ maybe I can take that donation address off the top and not need it at all.

I decided to add another feature along with including all the hashing functions of the main chain.

This was acomplished building this piece by piece and if it works for you, please send a small portion of a single block reward to the address at the top of the readme. I did not include any type of undermining and included everything in one file so as to not have a normal user jumping around from file to file to figure out what to do and why. I believe things should be open source and free. The time and effort I put into this, didn't cost me anything other than years worth of investing and learning. lol. Worth it!

âœ… Enable block template creation for mining operations âœ… Allow users to submit solutions for mined blocks âœ… Implement real-time tracking of chain tips âœ… Ensure compatibility with Bitcoin Coreâ€™s mining protocol âœ… Optimize nonce selection and fee adjustments

This will be the basis for our mining system, ensuring smooth block generation and submission while following Bitcoinâ€™s consensus rules. ðŸš€

End run, it will function as a bitcoin wallet with puzzle solving capabilities. If i feel nice, I'll incorporate a dark mode. XD
