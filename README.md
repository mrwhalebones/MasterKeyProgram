# MasterKeyProgram
WIF key generator for doing the generating of the WIFs(made for puzzle solving)


I was suposed to be starting a new job requiring two good legs and messed my foot up temporarily. If you want to donate for the free program and the hours I put into debugging and testing, here is my coinbase address: 34aYRB9jeSDXxNpjZBZpfETLJ2Tcw1H36G

This final version will be the powerhouse: ✅ Legacy address input with full manual range control ✅ Hex → WIF → ECDSA → Address (compressed & uncompressed) ✅ Two generation modes: Linear (manual input) & Random (π-based randomization) ✅ Live progress tracking & multithreading to prevent UI freeze-ups ✅ Popup menu dynamically displaying unsolved puzzles!

I am trying to make it super user friendly. the batch script is assuming you are running a drive E: with the files directly in it. modify it by selecting from file explorer(copy as path and just copy and paste over the path using the main python file as your selection and right click if in windows to initiate the copying and pasting of the file path or if a linux person..... you probably don't need the extra info ;-P )

I'm thinking of showing an x,y graph of key pairs so verification the same key being done over and over doesn't happen.

more like this:

Here’s what I’ll integrate into the final fully functional script: ✅ Unique file creation per puzzle (Puzzle Number + Timestamp Naming) ✅ List every hexadecimal key tested in each file ✅ Live visualization using an X,Y graph (instead of a progress bar) ✅ Multithreading for optimized puzzle solving ✅ Real-time WIF-to-address conversion without unnecessary storage. Makes sense?
